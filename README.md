Welcome to our Car application. we created to be used by 2 different types of user: a potential customer, and a employee of a specific dealership. 

The first step of our user interface is to prompt the user what type of user they are (customer, or dealer). if the user is a customer we give you options to search through your local dealership's inventory, or to search through all available car inventory. All available car inventory also allows the user to search a specific model. 

The last and possibly most important option we give our customers, is the ability to buy a car. once they find the car that they want, the can go to our buy car option and find the car that they want to purchase. Our app also transfers the title over to the new owner.

For the employees we give them many options pertaining to the specific dealership that they are working at. These options are catered to help your sales force by giving them the numbers they need to crush it. 


Thanks, Sincerely 

Beza, Danny, & Michael
